# Managing High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)

## What is Hypertension?

High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common condition where the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. It's often called the "silent killer" because it usually has no symptoms until it causes serious health problems.

## Understanding Blood Pressure Numbers

- **Normal**: Less than 120/80 mm Hg
- **Elevated**: 120-129/< 80 mm Hg
- **Stage 1 Hypertension**: 130-139/80-89 mm Hg
- **Stage 2 Hypertension**: 140/90 mm Hg or higher
- **Hypertensive Crisis**: Higher than 180/120 mm Hg

## Risk Factors

### Non-modifiable
- Age (risk increases with age)
- Family history
- Race/ethnicity (higher risk in African Americans)
- Gender (men at higher risk until age 64, women after 65)

### Modifiable
- Excess sodium in diet
- Lack of physical activity
- Obesity or being overweight
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Smoking
- Chronic stress
- Sleep apnea

## Lifestyle Modifications

### DASH Diet
- Focus on fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy
- Whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts
- Limit sodium to less than 2,300 mg/day (ideally 1,500 mg)
- Reduce saturated and trans fats

### Physical Activity
- At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise weekly
- Examples: brisk walking, swimming, cycling
- Strength training 2-3 times per week
- Even small amounts of activity help

### Other Lifestyle Changes
- Maintain healthy weight (BMI 18.5-24.9)
- Limit alcohol (1 drink/day women, 2 drinks/day men)
- Quit smoking
- Manage stress through meditation, yoga, or therapy
- Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep

## Medications

Common classes of blood pressure medications:
- **ACE inhibitors** (lisinopril, enalapril)
- **ARBs** (losartan, valsartan)
- **Diuretics** (hydrochlorothiazide)
- **Beta-blockers** (metoprolol, atenolol)
- **Calcium channel blockers** (amlodipine, diltiazem)

## Monitoring at Home

- Use a validated home blood pressure monitor
- Take readings at the same time daily
- Sit quietly for 5 minutes before measuring
- Avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking 30 minutes before
- Keep a log to share with your doctor
