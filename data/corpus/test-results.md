# Understanding Your Test Results

## Common Blood Tests

### Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- **Red blood cells (RBC)**: Carry oxygen throughout your body
- **White blood cells (WBC)**: Fight infections
- **Platelets**: Help with blood clotting
- **Hemoglobin**: Protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen

### Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)
- **Glucose**: Blood sugar levels
- **Creatinine**: Kidney function indicator
- **BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)**: Kidney function
- **Electrolytes** (sodium, potassium, chloride): Balance of fluids and minerals

### Lipid Panel
- **Total Cholesterol**: Overall cholesterol level
- **HDL Cholesterol**: "Good" cholesterol (higher is better)
- **LDL Cholesterol**: "Bad" cholesterol (lower is better)
- **Triglycerides**: Fat in the blood

## Understanding Normal Ranges

### Important Notes
- Normal ranges can vary by lab and individual factors
- Age, sex, and medical history affect what's "normal"
- Your doctor will interpret results in context
- One abnormal result doesn't always mean a problem

### When to Be Concerned
- Results significantly outside normal range
- Multiple related tests showing abnormalities
- Results that are trending worse over time
- Symptoms that match abnormal results

## Common Imaging Tests

### X-rays
- **Purpose**: View bones, lungs, and some soft tissues
- **Results**: Usually available quickly
- **Follow-up**: May need additional imaging for complete picture

### CT Scans
- **Purpose**: Detailed cross-sectional images
- **Results**: May take 1-2 days for radiologist interpretation
- **Follow-up**: Often definitive, but may need additional tests

### MRI
- **Purpose**: Detailed images of soft tissues, brain, spine
- **Results**: Usually within 24-48 hours
- **Follow-up**: May need contrast or specialized sequences

### Ultrasound
- **Purpose**: Real-time images using sound waves
- **Results**: Often immediate or same-day
- **Follow-up**: May need additional imaging for complete evaluation

## Questions to Ask About Results

### Understanding Your Results
- "What do these numbers mean for my health?"
- "Are these results normal for someone my age?"
- "What factors might affect these results?"
- "Do I need to repeat this test?"

### Next Steps
- "What do these results mean for my treatment?"
- "Do I need additional testing?"
- "Should I change my lifestyle or medications?"
- "When should I have this test again?"

### Concerning Results
- "What symptoms should I watch for?"
- "When should I be concerned?"
- "What can I do to improve these results?"
- "Do I need to see a specialist?"

## Getting Your Results

### How Results Are Shared
- **Online patient portal** (most common)
- **Phone call** from doctor's office
- **Letter** in the mail
- **Follow-up appointment**

### Timing Expectations
- **Blood tests**: 1-3 business days
- **Imaging**: 1-2 business days
- **Specialized tests**: 1-2 weeks
- **Biopsies**: 3-7 business days

## Red Flags - When to Call Immediately

### Blood Test Red Flags
- Severely low blood counts
- Extremely high blood sugar
- Abnormal kidney function
- Critical electrolyte imbalances

### Imaging Red Flags
- Acute findings requiring immediate attention
- Signs of infection or inflammation
- Unexpected masses or abnormalities
- Results suggesting emergency conditions

## Tips for Better Understanding

### Before Getting Results
- Ask what tests are being ordered and why
- Understand what the tests will show
- Know when to expect results
- Ask how results will be communicated

### When You Get Results
- Don't panic over isolated abnormal values
- Ask for explanations in plain language
- Request written summaries
- Clarify next steps and timeline

### Follow-Up
- Keep copies of all results
- Track trends over time
- Ask about normal ranges for your situation
- Discuss concerns with your healthcare team
