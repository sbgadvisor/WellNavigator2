# Understanding Type 2 Diabetes

## What is Type 2 Diabetes?

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). It occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels.

## Early Warning Signs

- Increased thirst and frequent urination
- Fatigue and weakness
- Blurred vision
- Slow-healing cuts or sores
- Tingling or numbness in hands or feet
- Unexplained weight loss

## Risk Factors

- Family history of diabetes
- Being overweight or obese
- Physical inactivity
- Age (45 or older)
- High blood pressure
- Abnormal cholesterol levels
- History of gestational diabetes

## Diagnosis

Your doctor will typically use one of these tests:
- **Fasting blood glucose test** (normal: under 100 mg/dL)
- **A1C test** (normal: under 5.7%)
- **Oral glucose tolerance test**
- **Random blood glucose test**

## Treatment Options

### Lifestyle Changes
- Healthy eating (focus on whole grains, lean proteins, vegetables)
- Regular physical activity (150 minutes/week moderate exercise)
- Weight management
- Stress reduction

### Medications
- Metformin (first-line treatment)
- Sulfonylureas
- DPP-4 inhibitors
- GLP-1 receptor agonists
- Insulin therapy (if needed)

## Questions to Ask Your Doctor

- What is my target blood sugar range?
- How often should I check my blood sugar?
- What should I do if my blood sugar is too high or too low?
- What are the signs of complications I should watch for?
- How can I prevent complications?
- When should I see an endocrinologist?

## Complications to Monitor

- Heart disease and stroke
- Kidney disease (nephropathy)
- Eye problems (retinopathy)
- Nerve damage (neuropathy)
- Foot problems
- Skin conditions

## Prevention

Even if you have prediabetes, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes by:
- Losing 5-7% of your body weight
- Exercising regularly
- Eating a healthy diet
- Managing stress
- Getting adequate sleep
